# Pattern Pursuit Challenge: 30-Day Deep Learning Journey in Quantitative Trading

> **_Note:_** This is a personal learning project documenting my journey in applying deep learning to quantitative trading. The code and implementations are for educational purposes and should not be considered as financial advice.*

## Overview
A systematic exploration of deep learning applications in quantitative trading, focusing on predicting 5-day forward returns for S&P 500 stocks. This personal challenge documents the development of a production-ready trading signal system, progressing from basic ML models to a comprehensive trading infrastructure.
- [Problem Statement](docs/overview/problem_statement.md)
- [Project Prerequisites](docs/setup/prerequisites.md)

## Project Scope
- **Primary Objective**: Build a robust system for predicting 5-day forward returns and generating actionable trading signals
- **Focus Area**: S&P 500 stocks
- **Duration**: 30 days of incremental development
- **End Goal**: Production-ready trading signal system with comprehensive risk management

## Essential Documentation
1. Review the [Prerequisites](docs/setup/prerequisites.md)
2. Follow the [Installation Guide](docs/setup/installation.md)
3. Explore the [Project Structure](docs/overview/structure.md)
4. Check [Development Guidelines](docs/development/guidelines.md)

## Daily Progress
Track the development journey:
- Each day's implementation is self-contained in `challenges/day_XX/`
- Qlens package development progresses in `core/`
- Comprehensive documentation available in `docs/`
- Shared resources and data in `data/`
