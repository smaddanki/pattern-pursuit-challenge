# Pattern Pursuit Challenge: 30-Day Deep Learning Journey in Quantitative Trading

## Overview
A systematic exploration of deep learning applications in quantitative trading, focusing on predicting 5-day forward returns for S&P 500 stocks. This personal challenge documents the development of a production-ready trading signal system, progressing from basic ML models to a comprehensive trading infrastructure.

## Project Scope
